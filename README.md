JOKE REPO - DO NOT USE.

Please do not make judgements about my character based on  this repo.

A fun, worthless trick to claim every line in a repo.


If you run this script, it will delete every file and folder in your directory, commit it, and then revert the commit, restoring everything
you deleted, but since you modified the file you are now the last contributor.

It won't register on a pull request as a changed file but you can now claim entire repos as your own work.

It's basically a very safe of way of breaking something so you can be the one who fixed it.
